# Project-Vehicle-Monitoring

The project vehicle monitor with node red and ESP8266 is a system that enable vehicle owners to remotely monitor their vehicles using and IOT device. The system uses an ESP8266 microcontroller board, which is connected to various sensors on the vehicle and then transmits data to a Node-RED server for analysis.

The system allows owners to track important parameters such as vehicle speed, fuel level, making it easier to identify any issues or potential problems before they become serious. Additionally, the Node-RED server can send alerts to the owner's or email if any of the monitored parameters exceed preset thresholds.

In addition to real-time monitoring and alerts, the Project Vehicle Monitor with Node-RED and ESP8266 can also save data to a Firebase database for long-term analysis and record-keeping.

The project combines hardware and software to create a reliable and efficient solution for vehicle monitoring, providing users with an intuitive dashboard to view their vehicle's data. With Node-RED's visual programming interface and the ESP8266's built-in WiFi capabilities, the system is easy to set up and customize for a variety of vehicles and use cases.
